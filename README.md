The goal of rsf is to provide an RStudio project template for a Report
of Statistical Findings (RSF) using the `bookdown` format.

## Installation

You can install the released version of rsf from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("rsf")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("dchiu911/rsf")
```

## Usage

After installation, you can choose the rsf project template by accessing
the RStudio menus: File \> New Project \> New Directory \> Report of
Statistical Findings using bookdown.
